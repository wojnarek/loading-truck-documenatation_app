# Application for photo documentation of truck loading

## Project description
The application is a small project that I did during my internship. The problem it solves was the documentation of cargo security on truck trailers. 
Prior to the creation of the application, the warehouse workers had to carry cameras with them from which, using a cable, they transferred photos to a network drive via a computer. 
The application was developed for Zebra terminals, which have cameras. Taken pictures go straight to the network drive, so employees saved time and could do it from their workplace.


## Technologies
- **Language**: Java
- **Android**: 10.0

## Functionality
The application allows you to scan barcodes that serve as identifiers for photos. 
In the application settings, you can define the server address and the destination folder. 
The application allows you to take 3 photos, view them and then send them to the server.
